  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>The muse in my art is the one that allows a conversation upon the ideas of happiness  
    and meaning in life. Life needs a full range of emotions to attain this valuable meaning   
    and my art displays this with a full range of mediums - both traditional and digital.     
    This range includes video art, installation and spatial design.</p>
  <p>I am interested in the emotions of others and what pillars in life run human emotion;  
    as well as how my art can send a message to allow others to understand these pillars as  
    well. By using my own life experiences and those of others, we can all hopefully find  
    fulfillment and true meaning in life.
