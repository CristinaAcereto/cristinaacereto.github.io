  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>The muse in my art is the one that allows a conversation upon the ideas of happiness  
    and meaning in life. Life needs a full range of emotions to attain this valuable meaning   
    and my art displays this with a full range of mediums - both traditional and digital.     
    This range includes video art, installation and spatial design.</p>
