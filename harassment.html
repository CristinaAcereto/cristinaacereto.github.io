  <h2>Hear Me. Listen. Respect Me. </h2>
  <p>Hear Me. Listen. Respect Me. is an experimental video discussing sexual harassment. I want to bring power to sexual harassment
    survivors and allow the platform for them to use it. The time is now to take your life back. Together, we can manifest hope in
    a way that brings us closer. We all have purpose and meaning, and no one can take that away from us. </p>
