  <h2>The Sad Trilogy of Unfamiliarity - Chapter 1: October 23rd </h2>
  <p>The Sad Trilogy of Unfamiliarity is an experimental video that allows insight into the passing of a loved one.
  It not only explains the thought of who is gone, but visually describes what the recipient emotes. Bringing together
  all aspects of what must be felt during a time like this, this video allows the time and space to grasp their feelings
  as well as yours.
  Watch Chapter 1 to tap into your most sorrowful thoughts.</p>
